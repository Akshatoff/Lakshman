## üìã Deployment Preparation

### Before Deploying
- [ ] All tests above passed
- [ ] No errors in console

  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm start
  ```
- [ ] Test production build works

### Deployment Steps

2. [ ] Connect GitHub repository
3. [ ] Set environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - DIRECT_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
4. [ ] Deploy
5. [ ] Run seed on production (if needed)
6. [ ] Test production URL
7. [ ] Verify image uploads work

## üîê Security - Before Production

### CRITICAL - Add Admin Authentication
**‚ö†Ô∏è Admin dashboard is currently public!**

- [ ] Install NextAuth.js or similar
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Protect `/admin/*` routes
- [ ] Add user session management
- [ ] Create admin user account

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### Database Issues
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Check database connection
npx prisma db push

# Reset database (deletes all data!)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### Image Upload Issues
1. Check `.env.local` has correct Cloudinary credentials
2. Verify upload preset exists and is **unsigned**
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test Cloudinary directly:
   - Go to Cloudinary dashboard
   - Upload ‚Üí Upload widget
   - Try manual upload

### API Issues
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Verify database is running
3. Check Prisma client is generated
4. Restart dev server

### No Products Showing
```bash
# Reseed database
npx prisma db seed
```
